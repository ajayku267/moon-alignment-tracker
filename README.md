## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/moon-alignment-tracker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd moon-alignment-tracker
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in your browser.

## üîß Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture using React:

- `src/components/`: UI components organized by functionality
- `src/context/`: Context API for state management
- `src/data/`: Data simulation and generation
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions including MapReduce implementation
- `src/workers/`: Web Workers for background processing

## üß† How Moon Alignment Prediction Works

The prediction system analyzes historical alignment patterns to forecast future events:

1. **Historical Analysis**: Calculates time intervals between past alignments
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Determines average intervals for each location
3. **Extrapolation**: Projects future alignments based on established patterns
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns reliability scores based on available data
5. **Simultaneous Detection**: Identifies potential multi-location alignments

## üåê Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Data Processing**: Custom MapReduce implementation
- **Map Visualization**: react-leaflet with heatmap extension
- **Charts**: Chart.js with date-fns adapter
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Web Workers API

## üìä Data Simulation

The application uses algorithmic data generation to simulate moon alignment patterns:

- Position calculations based on astronomical formulas
- Simulated visibility affected by time of day and lunar cycle
- Correlation of alignments across geographic locations
